    <h1 class="confession-title">
      You are the most amazing person to ever come into my life.
    </h1>

    <p class="confession-text">
      I made this page because i wanted to test my skills and to show you how much I care about you.
      
      My biggest fear isn't height or spiders or public speaking. it's losing you and not being enough for you.
    </p>

    <p class="confession-text">
      Every day that i dont get to see you are some of the hardest days of my life.
      But at the same time i always wake up and my first thought is you.
    </p>

    <div class="heart-divider">💗</div>

    <p class="confession-text">
      Abree, before i met you i was sad and lonley and felt like no one cared about me. And i was trying so hard to hide it and pretend to be happy.
      But as soon as i met you everything changed. 
    </p>

    <p class="confession-text">
      On our fisrt date i wasnt expecting it to go so well. I found out how much in common we had.
      After that date, i knew you were different. You understood me, you laughed with me and not at me. you made me feel like someone cared about me.
    </p>

    <p class="confession-text">
      Then came the second date, and the third, and the fourth. Each one better than the last.
      After each date i found myself thinking about you more and more to the point where i was questioning why i couldn't have met you sooner.
    </p>

    <div class="heart-divider">💞</div>

    <p class="confession-text">
      Now that you are my girlfriend, every moment i get to spend with you are some of the best moments of my life.
      And the time we are apart are some of the hardest times for me.
      Every day i dont get to see you makes me love you that much more.
    </p>

    <p class="confession-text">
      I know we have a long distance relationship right now, but i want you to know that no matter how far apart we are, my heart always belongs you.
    </p>

    <p class="confession-text" style="font-size:1.45rem; font-weight:700;">
      <span style="background: linear-gradient(135deg,#ff6f9c,#877aff); -webkit-background-clip:text; color:transparent;">
        I choose you — because you make me feel like i matter, like i am enough, and like i am loved.
      </span>
    </p>

    <p class="confession-text">
      <strong>I love you, Abree.</strong><br>
      Not just right now.<br>
      Not because i want to say it.<br>
      But because i mean it — deeply and truly.
    </p>

    <p class="confession-text" style="font-size:1.45rem; font-weight:700;">
      <span style="background: linear-gradient(135deg,#ff6f9c,#877aff); -webkit-background-clip:text; color:transparent;">
        I Love You Abree, Today, Tomorrow, and Always.
      </span>
    </p>

    <div class="heart-divider">💘</div>

    <p class="confession-text">
      You are not a temporary part of my life.
      You are not a maybe.
      You are not something I take lightly.
    </p>

    <p class="confession-text">
      You are my girlfriend.
      You are my person.
      You are my future
    </p>

    <p class="confession-text" style="font-size:1.4rem; font-weight:700;">
      I am yours.<br>
      Always yours.<br>
      Without a doubt in my mind
    </p>

    <div class="heart-divider">💓</div>

    <p class="confession-text">
      And no matter how far apart we are right now,
      my heart has already found its home.
    </p>
