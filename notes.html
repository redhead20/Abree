                        Hey you. I don’t know exactly what today threw at you,
                        but I do know this: you’ve handled so many hard days before,
                        and you’re still here, still trying, still showing up.
                        That’s something I’m really proud of.
                        <br /><br />
                        I wish I could be there every single time to make you laugh,
                        remind you you’re not alone, and tell you it’s okay to rest.
                        You don’t have to be “on” or “okay” all the time.
                        You’re allowed to just be human — and you’re my favorite human.

                        There’s something about your excited texts, your laughing face,
                        or your “you’ll never guess what happened” stories that just
                        makes everything better.
                        <br /><br />
                        When life feels good, I’m just extra grateful that I get to
                        be part of those good moments with you.
                        Thanks for letting me into your world like that. 🫶

                        I just want to remind you:
                        <br /><br />
                        You are more loved than your brain lets you believe sometimes.
                        You are not “too much.” You’re not “annoying.”
                        You’re not a problem to fix — you’re a person to love.
                        <br /><br />
                        And I like you. Really. For real. No overthinking required.

                        My Love,

                        I know there will be days when the distance feels heavy and you miss me more than usual. When
                        that happens, I want you to remember this: I’m missing you too — probably even more. Every mile
                        between us is just a reminder of how lucky I am to have someone worth missing.

                        Even though I can’t always be right next to you, my heart stays close to yours. You’re the first
                        person I think about in the morning and the last person on my mind at night. The distance can’t
                        take away how much I love you or how excited I am for every moment we get to spend together.

                        So when you miss me, hold onto this truth: I’m always with you — in your messages, in your
                        memories, in your laughter, and in the way my love wraps around you from far away. And one day,
                        the distance won’t be part of our story anymore.

                        Until then, I’m yours. Completely.
                        I love you.

                        — Peter 💙✨
